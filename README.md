# Campus-Placements-App

Now a days, the students are unaware of the campus recruitment company details, their activities, work environment in the company. The requirements of the company in order to get placed is not being well communicated to all the students. Also, the offline Training and placement cell to communicate with every student is a little bit tough task.

So, in order to avoid this, we are developing a mobile application which is informative, convenient and student friendly, this leads to enhanced job information discovery. The mobile application avoids the problems of existing systems and difficulty of student to discover jobs. Using the app, every student can login to access about company placement details, practice written tests, announcements of jobs in college and they can also communicate with college training and placement cell. The app also provides the materials, topics and requirements for a particular company. Therefore, students can get the information effectively, quickly and can crack the interviews of that company.
